       "[u\"Well i'm not sure about the story nad it did seem biased. What\\nI disagree with is your statement that the U.S. Media is out to\\nruin Israels reputation. That is rediculous. The U.S. media is\\nthe most pro-israeli media in the world. Having lived in Europe\\nI realize that incidences such as the one described in the\\nletter have occured. The U.S. media as a whole seem to try to\\nignore them. The U.S. is subsidizing Israels existance and the\\nEuropeans are not (at least not to the same degree). So I think\\nthat might be a reason they report more clearly on the\\natrocities.\\n\\tWhat is a shame is that in Austria, daily reports of\\nthe inhuman acts commited by Israeli soldiers and the blessing\\nreceived from the Government makes some of the Holocaust guilt\\ngo away. After all, look how the Jews are treating other races\\nwhen they got power. It is unfortunate.\\n\",\n",
       " u\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYeah, do you expect people to read the FAQ, etc. and actually accept hard\\natheism?  No, you need a little leap of faith, Jimmy.  Your logic runs out\\nof steam!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJim,\\n\\nSorry I can't pity you, Jim.  And I'm sorry that you have these feelings of\\ndenial about the faith you need to get by.  Oh well, just pretend that it will\\nall end happily ever after anyway.  Maybe if you start a new newsgroup,\\nalt.atheist.hard, you won't be bummin' so much?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBye-Bye, Big Jim.  Don't forget your Flintstone's Chewables!  :) \\n--\\nBake Timmons, III\",\n",
       " u\"Although I realize that principle is not one of your strongest\\npoints, I would still like to know why do do not ask any question\\nof this sort about the Arab countries.\\n\\n   If you want to continue this think tank charade of yours, your\\nfixation on Israel must stop.  You might have to start asking the\\nsame sort of questions of Arab countries as well.  You realize it\\nwould not work, as the Arab countries' treatment of Jews over the\\nlast several decades is so bad that your fixation on Israel would\\nbegin to look like the biased attack that it is.\\n\\n   Everyone in this group recognizes that your stupid 'Center for\\nPolicy Research' is nothing more than a fancy name for some bigot\\nwho hates Israel.\"]"
